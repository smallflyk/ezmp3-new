# EZMP3

<em> Powered by Youtube-in-mp3.com <em>

A sleek, single-page, easy to navigate Youtube video viewer/converter/downloader. Easily find, watch, convert to mp3, and download your favorite
songs. Built over a one week period while I was at home after a tonsillectomy.

## Goals

1) Save myself time by removing a step from the workflow of converting a song on Youtube -> mp3 on my phone. 
2) Learn a bit on how to query the Youtube Data API, and gain more experience in general with working with APIs.

## Result? 

I achieved goals 1 and 2, but in the process, I also achieved the following:

1) Learned more about the converting a file to an InputStream/FileStream in order to download an mp3 file.
2) Discovered how scarce any APIs on converting videos to mp3s actually were.
